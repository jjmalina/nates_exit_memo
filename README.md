Everything I Know About HackDays
================================

This is a list of everything I know about what it takes to put on a successful
HackDays event. I ran HackDays from November 2011 to May 2012, and put on probably 
30+ HackDays events during that time. I wanted to create this to let me successor
know everything I know now about what it takes to create a fun HackDays event.

Things I Learned
----------------
1. Attendance is no longer an issue for Hackdays. The meetup group is strong
enough that attendance is guaranteed to be at least 10, usually more for popular
talks.
2. The reason people come to Hackdays is the format of the talks. 1 hr to 1 1/2 hrs
total is a good length, and people generally are coming to be introduced to new
technologies.
3. 101 level talks are the most popular. Put "beginners", "101" etc in the title
for the biggest attendance.
4. Anything with 'Data' in the title is twice as well attended as a regular event.
5. Aggresively policing the Meetup's join requests is a good way to ensure a 
 good audience. 
6. I moved Hackdays at the end of the year to 5pm, (instead of 4pm and talks
starting at 5pm), and I don't think it worked. Too many people just started
showing up late.
7. Getting presenters is easy as hell. Just find someone who uses a technology
you think is cool, and ask. 100% of the time they'll agree to do a Hackday.
8. Fill up the schedule 1 month at a time. 2 weeks before the new month, start
looking for speakers, and have every Friday filled up as soon as the 1st of the
month rolls around. This makes it less stressful for you.

Things That You Could Improve On
--------------------------------
1. I regret not doing a better job of getting people to talk to each other at Hackdays. People mostly just sit around for an hour before the talks start. This
was wasted time, and something could be done about getting students actually talking
to each other during that time.
2. Pre-screening of presenters might become more important. If they've done
talks before, there is usually video of that on the internet somewhere. The
quality of the speaker REALLY determines the quality of the event.


Everything I Know About DemoDays
================================

Things I Learned
----------------
1. Art/code speakers generally work out the best, for several reasons. They're
technical, but not *that* technical. They also tend to have past work that is
extremely visual and easy to understand. Highly technical speakers, no matter
how famous their work, can make for very poor speakers.
2. Attendance is the NUMBER ONE FACTOR in a successful DemoDay. At it's root, 
DemoDays is a party - and everyone wants to think they're at the coolest party
in town. 
3. Attendance is not easy, at all. Generally 60+ Meetup RSVPs is a good number. If
attendance is low, you will need to personally email every group member to ask
if they are coming (this is 3-4 hours of work, but it WORKS.)
4. Bad DemoDays are REALLY not good, because people will judge that ALL demodays
are bad, and stop coming to them. Every DemoDay builds attendance for the next one,
so it is important that every DemoDay is good.
5. Demos: timing them is important. Bad demos are fine, as long as they're short.
6. Courant auditorium is really not a great place for the event because of building
security. Anywhere else would be much better. Pivotal Labs was awesome.
7. Unlike Hackdays, it is IMPOSSIBLE to throw together a DemoDays last minute. I
threw together a DemoDay or two 7 days before and it SUCKED (both in difficulty
and in the event quality). Don't do it. Reserve the space 3 weeks beforehand. Put up
RSVP links and start promoting 2 weeks beforehand (also have the spakers locked up
by this point.) Have demoers locked up 5 days before.

Things You Could Improve On
---------------------------
1. Again, I regret not doing a better job of getting DemoDays attendees talking
to each other. It's not enough to say 'just talk to each other'. Pizza was a good
way to get people talking to each other, but we can do more.
2. Converting DemoDays attendees into attending other events.
3. Reward early attendees with something that occurs before DemoDays begins.
